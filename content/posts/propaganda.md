If there's one slogan that has been forcefully drilled into the skull of every educated individual (i.e. __all individuals__) in western society, is that democracy is a Good<sup>TM</sup> thing.

However, I don't recall any mention of how this whole thing is supposed to work. You know, how do you get all of these people, in all these different groups, to choose rulers that will act on their best interests and make sure that they keep doing so without abusing their position? If the state has the police and the laws, how come that the citizens (who are essentially its _subjects_) have the power to keep state power in check?

Does democracy actually lead to desirable outcomes? And why do we think that it does? Or do we only _think_ that it does?

You could argue it has at least _survived_ so far: most of the western world (USA, Canada, Europe, etc.) is under the control of democratic regimes: those in power are chosen through elections where all the citizens participate and where one citizen equals one vote. Even those that we consider totalitarian, corrupt or autocratic (Russia, China, Iraq, etc.) still hold some form of elections.

However, the general prevalence of democracy as a system of government is maybe 100 years old, and up to 30 years ago when the Berlin Wall came down it was not 100% clear that it the "liberal" western state would prevail against the bureaucratic oligarchy model of the Soviet Union. But somehow it did, and it did so mostly everywhere.

After reading _Propaganda_ by Edward Bernays and  _Public Opinion_ by Walter Lippmann, I have some inkling of an idea of the reasons why. It has nothing to do with it choosing good sovereigns, giving the power to the people, or making the state serve the best interests of the electorate.

It works because of a technology and a protocol: Mass Communications and Public Schooling. Those with access to Mass Communications can use that asymmetry with their audience to build a set of facts and interpretations, a narrative or _pseudo environment_, and make it reach the whole citizenship so that all the different self-interested groups converge in a common understanding of the world, even when they would not be able to individually comprehend it. This organization of the thoughts and ideas of the public leads to sovereign states becoming publicly supported oligarchies, whose members are those that can successfully manufacture consent: the intellectuals, the academics, the journalists and the civil service. A primary role of the technology was (and is) allowing manipulation of opinion to scale up to the size of modern populations.

In short, the main pillar of democratic society is Propaganda.

## II.

Edward Bernays points to this in the literal __first paragraph__ of _Propaganda_:

{{<snippet author="Edward Bernays" book="Propaganda, Chapter I - Organizing Chaos">}}
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
{{</snippet>}}

Bernays very succinctly and eloquently justifies the thesis over several chapters. Essentially, the world is too vast and distant, possible decisions too many to be able to account for all factors, so we must delegate to others to summarize, check and organize them. In a world where there is an information network, built on top of mass communication technologies (the radio, TV, magazines, newspapers, trains) that can deliver messages to a large population at very fast speeds, this delegation becomes crucial and gives massive power to the originators of the Propaganda because of how much larger the facts, interpretations and possible decisions become.

And a key thing to stress is that for both Bernays and Lippmann, this is not a bug, it is a __core feature__ of Propaganda: it makes the democratic system actually function.

{{<snippet author="Edward Bernays" book="Propaganda, Chapter I - Organizing Chaos">}}
To deplore the existence of such a mechanism \[with which democracy organizes its public mind and simplified its mass thinking\] is to ask for a society such as never was and never will be. To admit that it exists, but expect that it shall not be used is unreasonable.
{{</snippet>}}

Lippmann's book _Public Opinion_ also echoes this justification.

{{<snippet author="Walter Lippmann" book="Public Opinion - Chapter XXVII - The Appeal to the Public">}}
The amount of attention available is far too small for any scheme in which it was assumed that all the citizens of the nation would, after devoting themselves to the publications of all the intelligence bureaus, become alert, informed, and eager on the multitude of real questions that never do fit very well into any broad principle.

[...]

The purpose, then, is not to burden every citizen with expert opinions on all questions, but to push that burden away from him towards the responsible administrator.
{{</snippet>}}

Bernays focuses mostly on how Propaganda affects all aspects of social life under modernity (at least as understood in 1928).

We could naively assume that Propaganda is just censorship and cherrypicked facts, but it goes far beyond that. _. The Invisible Government can efficiently target everybody, not just through the mechanisms of mass media, but also because of the inherently hierarchical nature of human relationships: it can appeal and convince the many by focusing on the how these are influenced by the ideas of the few. That allows almost "conspiracy" levels of social control to happen quite smoothly.

The efficient propagandist (what we could also call a _Marketer_) does not try to persuade you through facts or rational arguments to e.g. acquire a product. Instead it sells you the _beliefs_ and _circumstances_ necessary for the _need_ for the product to emerge spontaneously. It manufactures not just _facts_ but also _ interpretations, wants and wishes_.

Bernays argues that this is necessary for the efficient operation of a free market society: factories function much better when running at full capacity, because of the economies of scale, so it is necessary to guarantee that the resulting product is sold even when there is too much of it. Therefore, how to _create_ the demand for the product becomes a, if not _the_, primary concern.

Bernays also points that it is not necessary to even appeal to the public directly, but instead go through the people that matter, what we would call the _VIP_, because authority in society is hierarchical and based on status.

{{<snippet author="Edward Bernays" book="Propaganda, Chapter III - The New Propagandists">}}
There are invisible rulers who control the destinies of millions. It is not generally realized to what extent the words and actions of our most influential public men are dictated by shrewd persons operating behind the scenes.

[...]

In some departments of our daily life, in which we imagine ourselves free agents, we are ruled by dictators exercising great power.
{{</snippet>}}

For instance, to market velvet, the manufacturers first reach out to the famous and respected French couturiers to make them use velvet in their clothes, and then make some Countess or Movie Star use these clothes, and displaying them in their movies or on TV or in photos for magazines. This established velvet as _in fashion_ again and much increased sales.

Another example comes from selling pianos: Bernays exposes how you can first establish the idea of having _a music room_ in the house, through exhibitions from famous architects to high society and
affluent members of the public. All of the showcases in the exhibition should display a music room. This normalizes the idea of having one of those, and when the rich and affluent start building their houses (in the style of the fashion), they will run into a problem.

Now they have a music room...and what do you put in a music room...?

At that point, they will come to you for a piano.

We are somewhat familiar with this type of marketing, but at the moment the book was written, it was very new, the technology that facilitated it was just getting established, and after the WWI propaganda the public had quite a bad taste for these types of tactics, so it had to be legitimized.

Which makes me think that it has probably gotten even _more_ advanced than that. How indirectly can this need for a product be crated?

Think about it next time that you feel like you must _follow your passion_, or _live your life_, or that _travel opens your mind_, or that you should strive to _save the world_. Maybe all those things were implanted?

Maybe these methods are in use now for those ideals you hold so dear...Democracy? Civil Liberties? Collective Rights?

## III.

There is a sense of pragmatism and a bit of optimism in Bernays for how Propaganda fits into modern society.

Lippmann's is a much more _disillusioned view_, he comes from a position of seeing this effect and contrasting it with the previous theories of how Democratic Society is supposed to work: the idea that self-centered opinion of the public would lead to a consistent and coherent will that must enacted by the government, i.e. the government serves the People.

Mind you, this is not a fringe or outdated idea: I would say this is __the dominant theory of how the whole system works__.

{{<snippet author="Walter Lippmann" book="Public Opinion - Leaders And The Rank and File">}}
It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge needed for the management of the human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart.

It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.
{{</snippet>}}

To critique this quixotic theory of democracy, Lippmann goes into much more depth on the the ideas of environment, discussing the origin of stereotypes, of symbols and slogans into which the opinions of the many converge, and the need of a _cohesive_ narrative with which the government can organize the governed.

Lippmann points out the increasing distance between the democratic agent and the scope of interests of its government: once we leave the idyllic self contained community or tribe where everybody is engaged in all its areas of concern, to the state/province, to the country, foreign nations and affairs, the facts become increasingly distant and it is therefore harder to convince these disparate communities, because the ideas and concepts are completely alien to most of them.

How is Democratic Man supposed to get information of how these distant things work? And how are these myriad sources organized into any coherent narrative?

Lippmann argues that we already possess this narrative, from our stereotypes, our biases, our group opinions, and that reflected on us by those that are in power: the politicians, the intellectuals, the highly respected (e.g. the army generals in Lippmann's time) and the mass media.

{{<snippet author="Edward Bernays" book="Propaganda, Chapter I - Organizing Chaos">}}
But instead of a mind, universal literacy has given \[the common man\] rubber stamps, rubber stamps inked with advertising slogans, with editorials, with published scientific data, with the trivialities of the tabloids and the platitudes of history, but quite innocent of original thought.
{{</snippet>}}

The propagandists, the journalists, politicians, and academics must create encompassing narratives that provide _meaning_, drive legitimate and rationalized (not _rational_, _rationalized_) action in a common direction. They must organize, conceptualize and frame the myriad single facts that you require to behave properly in society, _to believe in_ Society, even to _imagine_ such thing as _a Society_.

Government requires organized action, and that in turn that requires convergence into ideas. Actions can then be undertaken since these collective ideas ensure public support (at least to some degree). Therefore, the Government also requires the existence of the narrative to function.

{{<snippet author="Edward Bernays" book="Propaganda, Chapter II - The New Propaganda">}}
The practice of creating circumstances and of creating pictures in the minds of millions of persons is very common. Virtually no important undertaking is now carried on
without it...In our present social organization approval of the public is essential to any large undertaking.
{{</snippet>}}

And for building this narrative, there needs to be distance from the public to the facts, either natural (physical distance) or artificial (censorship and editorializing by middlemen).

{{<snippet author="Walter Lippmann" book="Public Opinion - Chapter II - Censorship and Privacy">}}
Without some form of censorship, propaganda in the strict sense of the word is impossible. In order to conduct a propaganda there must be some barrier between the public and the event. Access to the real environment must be limited, before anyone can create a pseudo-environment that he thinks wise or desirable.

It is often very illuminating, therefore, to ask yourself how you got at the facts on which you base your opinion. Who actually saw, heard, felt, counted, named the thing, about which you have an opinion? Was it the man who told you, or the man who told him, or someone still further removed?
{{</snippet>}}

## IV.

Does this distance exist today?

To paraphrase Marshall McLuhan, any technological medium will change the scope of human relationships, the protocols that form the basis for societal networks.

For example, in the previous example of _velvet_ marketing, the magazine with photographs and the movies are _necessary_ for the scheme to work at very large scale: it increases the reach of the Duchess wearing the velvet hat, makes the image more vivid than it would be through a dry narration. The Movie Star, the TV personalities, or the guitarist with the 100W tube amp have at their disposal means to more effectively grab attention and amplify their message. Notice that these technological changes were all in the hands of a relatively producers: the network was theirs.

Before, the producers were limited, and the power of the mediums meant their ideology was the most amplified.

However, increased connectivity and lower barriers to entry that The Internet and Social Media introduce a lot more producers into the scene. Even if the Gutenberg press created the printed word, lowered the cost of information production (leading to revolutions such as the Protestant schism with the Catholic Church and the rise of individualism), the exponential acceleration that the advent of the internet brings has IMO no precedent in history. It means that the safe space where you can avoid [_Future Nausea_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/05/09/welcome-to-the-future-nauseous/) gets smaller and smaller, it's existence gets shorter and shorter.

Now within less than a single generation you see the whole frame of reference that allows you to understand your culture shift under your feet. It used to take until you became 40 or a bit later, now it's probably around 30 that you start experiencing it, and it seems to be getting faster. The constant reception of facts and the never ending struggle to make sense of them begets a dissociating and unpleasant feeling, and shakes your relative status position you have been climbing for your whole life.

With the internet, everybody is a producer of content, or an amplifier of others content, a relay in the network, at the job 24/7/365. The means that would elevate a message (being part of the script for a Hollywood movie, the lyrics and backing music for a chart-topping pop song) are now almost entirely accessible to  every computer user, a.k.a. __every person__ in the western world.

You no longer need an orchestra and the approval of theaters to enhance and distribute a propaganda piece that exalts the virtues of your traditions, culture, or thoughts. You no longer even need any physical device beyond a laptop, or any distribution beyond Soundcloud and Bandcamp.

You can write into Substack or Wordpress and see yourself with an audience in the millions, in less time than it used to take to mail a draft to the publisher.

If we believe the message of _Public Opinion_ and _Propaganda_, that the public opinion needs to be organized and manipulated into _order_ and _consensus_ to ultimately get the _consent_, how can the Invisible Government achieve that when every voice, not just the ones from the powerful, is amplified and distributed through network effects? Wouldn't that upset the primary method they possess to maintain their power?

It no longer seems so surprising that mainstream academics and news outlets are suddenly so distressed about _virality_, Social Media creating _polarization_, and allowing the spread of _Fake News_, does it?

## V.

{{<quote author="Hideo Kojima" source="Metal Gear Solid 2">}}
Raiden: And you think you're qualified to decide what's necessary and not!?

GW: Absolutely. Who else could wade through the sea of garbage you people produce, retrieve valuable truths and even interpret their meaning for later generations?

GW: That's what it means to create context.
{{</quote>}}

This all seems _prima facie_ horrible. Those in power brainwashing the population? Is that kinda like slavery? Who gave them the right? What if I disagree?

Should we then...change it? But what are the alternatives?

Lippmann argues for a decentralization of decision, based on having exhaustive collection and analysis of information and records. I believe this to be both impossible, because this way of
taking decisions leads nowhere: committees devolve into politics and power plays since the reality is too complex, communication gets quadratically more expensive with the number of participants,
and the decision makers are still humans sensitive to biases and status plays.

So a elite will naturally form, and this elite needs to be legitimized in some way. Democracy is the façade, since the consent is manufactured through Propaganda. Even before Lippmann and Bernays
there were political theoreticians that remarked [this is inevitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy).

Is there a better way?

As complex systems grow and become more established, they become more and more _risk_ averse and must lower volatility. In this case,  volatility can come from the frictions of the diverse groups and their beliefs and the complexity of the relationships that these groups have with one another, their relative power and sizes, and the mechanisms for achieving consensus in their disputes.

Inhabitants of democratic countries with a well established propaganda machine, where public schooling is mandatory and universal, the media has a well established line and the narrative is consistent, do seem more peaceful prosperous and civilized and to think in similar terms. Even when they become dissatisfied with the system the mass media managed to make them pick opposition through a limited subset of ideas. When this is not the case, and there is no consistent narrative, the chances that the population will get split up based on competing sets of ideas, and the lack of incentives for cooperation (e.g. because of lack of a free market), then you have all the ingredients for, in "happy" terms, a _revolution_, and in bad terms, a _civil war_, and in real terms, _blowing up cars and bombing government buildings_.

Where I think the problem lies, is that democracy is like _fiat_ currencies: _at best, it is stably decaying_. It might be the best we can achieve, and there is a case that complex societies just inevitably collapse.

This how I think it goes. And to be honest, this is pretty much going to end being my bad interpretation of [Unqualified Reservations](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/).

The academics and journalists (The Invisible Government) have no power above them. They many times have no [Skin in the Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_\(book\)), they operate far away from the consequences of their actions and their ideas. There is no incentive, then, for these to be grounded on anything reasonable. With the capacity of data manipulation and statistical biasing, even research can be fabricated to suit any desired conclusion. Or [it can be complete sophistry to support the powers-that-be](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/james-burnhams-dante-politics-as-wish/).

That means their ideas will start drifting from measurable and falsifiable, i.e. _objective_ reality. This means that their surface area, the possible _vulneratibilities_, rises. And with that, and the means of, alternative narratives will start to form, and will have a basis for achieving convergence and mindshare.

{{<snippet author="Walter Lippmann" book="Public Opinion, Chapter XXIV: News, Truth and a Conclusion.">}}
Only at those points, where social conditions take recognizable and measurable shape, do the body of truth
and the body of news coincide. That is a comparatively small part of the whole field of human interest.
In this sector, and only in this sector, the tests of the news are sufficiently exact to make the changes of
perversion or suppression more than a partisan judgment.

[...]

[The journalist] cannot deny that he too is, as Shelley remarked, a dome of many-colored
class which stains the white radiance of eternity.
{{</snippet>}}

With exponential growth of information production through Social Media, so many bits of information floating around, impossible to verify or even to contextualize, complexity of society accelerates to the a point beyond the capacity the audience or even the media to sync it up. The alternative narratives get a foothold, start to challenge the primary one. This goes on top of all the existing sources of complexity in society that keep increasing: the vast number of ways that human beings connect and interact with each other.

{{<snippet author="Walter Lippmann" book="Public Opinion, Chapter XXIV: News, Truth and a Conclusion.">}}
[The press] is too frail to carry the whole burden of popular sovereignty, to supply spontaneously
the truth which democrats hoped was inborn. And when we expect it to supply such a body of
truth we employ a misleading standard of judgment. We misunderstand the limited nature
of news, the illimitable complexity of society;we overestimate our own endurance, public spirit,
and all-around competence.

[...]

Acting upon everybody for thirty minutes in twenty-four hours, the press
is asked to create a mystical force called Public Opinion that will take up the slack in public institutions.
{{</snippet>}}

The tool that sustains the public opinion, that legitimizes the oligarchy, cannot adapt fast enough. It can no longer meaningfully add the necessary context to derive a synthesis between the narrative and the new information. This means that groups might start to ignore it, to question it, and to seek others. The conflicts between groups will resurface as they . The result is a power vacuum, and we already discussed how those end...

If you fear, do not worry, there won't be a civil war anytime soon. I hope.

For now the interpretations, stereotypes and storytelling mechanisms that were ingrained into you are not going anywhere. Neither are your friends and your social circle, i.e. the consensus layer that keeps you inside the acceptable opinions space. For a while all the producers of information went to the same schools and have not been exposed for that long to the dizzying discourse of Social Media. Even the methods of rebellion are fitted into the Procrustian bed that is the _Overtone Window_.

So, if you decide to engage in the political discourse, you will keep validating The System, even as a dissident. The landscape will just seem more and more strange, more alien, more incomprehensible, and more divided.

Until it is too late.
