It seems the new fashionable thing to say that social media is a drug.

And not a cool drug like the ones you get at parties _to_ party. One of the bad ones, you know the ones that irredemeably and irrecovereably ruin the perfectly nice life that you made up in your head. The one where nothing ever goes wrong and achieving your half-heartedly chosen goals is easy peasy lemon squeezy.

What is more, it is _cool_ to call oneself an _addict_ to social media. On social media.

Given the currently pushed narrative against Social Media[^1] as a cause of the general publics distrust against the usual wielders of propaganda (the mainstream news and universities), I am not exactly suprised.

However, I do not want to focus on that here, it's a discussion for another post.

For now, let's begin with the two facts that Social Media _is already here_, and _it will not go away_: you cannot ban it, forbid it or legislate it away, that will not work.

What I am more interested in is the individual, i.e. how this existance relates to __me__ and to __you__. And the consequences of using a loaded word such as _addiction_ to the interactions with Social Media.

I ponder about the following, which I consider more than a bit strange.

You can go in public on the internet, and out loud, call yourself a Social Media Addict, as in "I __AM__ a social media addict", and then suffer _no social consecuences_, even get sympathy and approval for it? Writing a post claiming you are [commited to being productive or hard working](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/05/what-is-signaling.html), and then provide some socially acceptable reason of why you cannot _actually do_ the hard work, and then _keep doing what you were doing_?

Doesn't that sound a bit like...an excuse?

{{<quote author="The Last Psychiatrist" source="[_The Abusive Boyfriend_](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/04/the_abusive_boyfriend.html)">}}
The unconscious doesn't care about happiness, or sadness, or gifts, or bullets.  It has one single goal, protect the ego, protect status quo.  _Do not change and you will not die._

[...]

The men, or women, aren't lying to you, and you're not even lying to yourself.

_You are being lied to, by yourself_.
{{</quote>}}

When you go out and say _I am X_, you are actually reinforcing all of the processes inside of your head that make you keep doing whatever activity "X" entails. In particular, when you claim to be an "X addict". You are defining and maintaining the status quo.

You do not _want_ to change. You want to _want to change_, but not the actual process. Change is hard, painful, it is actual _work_. It requires effort, a lot of time and can even put you at odds with your social circle ("sorry dudes, cannot play videogames all night, I have gym tomorrow"). It causes stress to your ego.

So if the action you are taking is neither of those, then it will reinforce the _status quo_. I.e. reading way too much Reddit.

To make it worse, your claim then gets you sympathy or approval for the action. These act as a reward and close loop of the game you and your family/friends/fellow internet denizens [are now playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)).

What this means then is that you will keep binging Youtube, because you are now in a cycle of

```text
10 Watch Youtube.
20 Feel bad about it.
30 Write/Talk about it with your friends.
40 Get Reward (Sympathy / Internet points).
50 GOTO 10
```

Going even further, you are diminishing your belief in your own agency and control over your
life. Addiction means that you cannot stop, to the point that you need higher doses of whatever stimulus you claim to be addicted to.

"If I continue to call gaming an addiction it takes away the element of choice these people have," he says. "It's a complete shift in my thinking and also a shift in the thinking of my clinic and the way it treats these people."

[...]

"In most cases of compulsive gaming, it is not addiction and in that case, the solution lies elsewhere."

## III.

Your beliefs determine your actions. So the belief that your actions matter to achieve your goals is _sine qua non_ the most important. Without a belief in acting to improve your circumstances, you will be driven to stasis, to maintain the _status quo_. Which, as described above, is ane extremely strong tendency already.

Therefore, lowering the strength of your belief in your self determination and your capacity to control and change your actions is quite bad, [from a pragmatic standpoint](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/38). Taking a mental framing of _I am an Addict_ is a large step in this terrible direction.

In fact, this is a common theme to the mental models and beliefs that make poor people stay
poor, and make heroine junkies stay junkies instead of users. See [_Life at the Bottom_](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Bottom-Worldview-Makes-Underclass/dp/1566635055) for some
quite graphic examples of this phenomenon with the British underclass.

There might be genuine physical or causes that make Social Media a superstimulous. But calling yourself an _addict_, given the social acceptance/sympathy you get from it, and the way it changes how you plan and perform actions as I said above, will only add more fuel to the fire.

At every point, you have a choice. Your actions are _your choice_. To believe otherwise is madness.

## IV.

You write a blogpost of how much you want to learn Japanese but instead spend your time watching Youtube videos.

The question is not whether you want to watch the Youtube videos. This you know deep inside because it drives the only thing that matters: your actions.

The question is: __Do you actually want to learn Japanese?__

Why? Do you actually have a _reason_? Like a concrete, actionable, immediate reason? And given this reason, what are you going to _do_ about it?

Or instead, could it be that...that's what the kind of person you imagine yourself to be _would do_. In the movie that you run inside of your head?

Is it because that person would then go around feeling superior to all the other _normies_? The ones you don't actually picture as genuine people, but robots, or NPCs?

Do you think kids going around with their bycicles or trying to climb up the trees need to Pomodoro their playtime?

## V.

Ok, so you actually want to quit watching porn/Youtube/reading Instagram/Reddit or whatever. For whatever reason: that is not important.

I have no idea how YOU can do it, I am not you and I do not know you at all. Maybe your life is really boring, or your family is abusive, or you feel lonely and you cope through Youtube or Reddit. YMMV.

However, I can offer this quote on how to quit porn:

{{<snippet caption="The Last Psychiatrist, _The Effects Of Too Much Porn: \"He\'s Just Not That Into Anyone\"_, Part VII" source="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7746471.stm">}}
Easier said than done, I know, but the thing I find helps most people is to understand that you can't refrain from doing something you like.  You can, however, change the person you are into the kind of person who doesn't even like that stuff.

[...]

This may not be a reassuring solution to some, but I can promise you that it is the only solution: you have to decide you're not the kind of person who wastes time on that.  Condemning it, banning it, hiding from it-- all will lead to failure.  Lust isn't the trigger,  boredom is, idle hands are something or other, so the sooner you get a default activity, the better.

Remember your parents mindlessly watching some Gossip/Reality Show on TV? Times have changed. Youtube is the new TV. That's fine, but if it's not for you, maybe try _doing_ whatever it is people that _don't watch Youtube all day_, that do not even _like_ watching Youtube, do _instead_.

This will actually be a difficult thing to do. It will require you to take difficult actions and will feel very unpleasant at times. I have done only minor versions of this change: it is _work_, and it does not really end. But it gets easier, and it's worth it.
